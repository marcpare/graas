Developing graas
================

TODO:

* How to deploy? (pip? fabric?)
* How to hook up on the windows client side? wget via cygwin?
* How do we make the memcached a capped collection?
* Plot not found image
* Push to github
* API key to track usage
* A screen session to jump up with my local dev environment would rock.

memcached
---------

Start the server:

    memcached -m 24 -p 8081 -vv

Loading a client and get/setting data:

    CACHE_BACKEND = '127.0.0.1'
    mc = memcache.Client([CACHE_BACKEND], debug=0)
    mc.set("some_key", "some_value")
    mc.get("some_key")

Getting help
    
    memcached -h

bottle.py server
----------------

Just run the main Python file.

Generating Charts
-----------------

The code documents this well enough. The trick is that you have to change the back end that renders the charts to something else. That is done at the top of the Python file. After that you can dump the binary of the images into whatever data storage you like.
